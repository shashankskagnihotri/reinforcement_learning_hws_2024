# Exercise 03
In this exercise we will use the included `racetrack_environment` in order to write our first reinforcement learning algorithm. 
The used algorithm is Monte-Carlo learning in an on- and off-policy fashion.
## Tasks:
  1. policy evaluation using first-visit Monte-Carlo
  2. on-policy epsilon-greedy control using first-visit Monte-Carlo
  3. Extra Challenge
